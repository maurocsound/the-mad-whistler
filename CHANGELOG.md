# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file (I hope).
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### To add
- I should add some buttons to change the global params at runtime from the GUI.

## [0.11] - 2018-10-28
### Added
- A whistle without a blow is not a real whistle, so I added a blow.
- Added this changelog file.

### Changed
- The whistle frequency range was not so realistic, especially in the lower pitches, so I changed it.
- Some cosmetic changes to the code.

## 0.10 - 2018-10-28
- The first version. The start of the Masterpiece. :-D
