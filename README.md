For foolish musicians who need to whistle...

This is a Csound program that will make your computer whistle when you move the mouse in the program window.
With horizontal mouse movements, you will change the pitch. 
With vertical movements, you will change the amplitude.

Thanks to all Csound developers for creating such a fun sound and music composition language! :-)

## Instructions
Download the file tmw.csd, open it with CsoundQT or similar Csound IDE (or just copy and paste its code in a new tab of the IDE) and enjoy some fun!
